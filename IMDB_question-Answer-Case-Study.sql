-- Segment 1

-- Q1. Find the total number of rows in each table of the schema?
-- Type your code below:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS No_of_row_role_mapping FROM role_mapping;

-- Total nos of rows = 15615


-- Q2. Which columns in the movie table have null values?
-- Type your code below:

SELECT * FROM movie;

SELECT Sum(CASE

ELSE 0
END) AS id_null_count,
Sum(CASE

-- Q5. Find the unique list of the genres present in the data set?
-- Type your code below:

-- Output -- Drama -- Fantasy -- Thriller -- Comedy -- Horror -- Family -- Romance -- Adventure -- Action -- Sci-Fi -- Crime -- Mystery -- Others


/* So, RSVP Movies plans to make a movie of one of these genres.
Now, wouldn’t you want to know which genre had the highest number of movies produced in the last year?

-- Multilingual is the important piece in the above question. It was created using POSITION(',' IN languages)>0 logic
-- If there is a comma, that means the movie is of more than one language


-- Q28. Who are the top 3 actresses based on the number of Super Hit movies (Superhit movie: average rating of movie > 8) in 'drama' genre?

-- Note: Consider only superhit movies to calculate the actress average ratings.
-- (Hint: You should use the weighted average based on votes. If the ratings clash, then the total number of votes
-- should act as the tie breaker. If number of votes are same, sort alphabetically by actress name.)
